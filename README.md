# 🏥 Healthcare Analytics Dashboard – Power BI Project

This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard that analyses hospital performance across multiple dimensions, including Length of Stay (LOS), Cost per Discharge, Severity of Illness, and Risk of Mortality. The dashboard is designed to help healthcare professionals and stakeholders make data-driven decisions to optimise patient care and resource allocation.

## 📌 Project Overview

The dataset includes discharge information from **151 hospitals** with over **26,000 patient records**, capturing key variables like:

- 🛏️ **Average Length of Stay (LOS)**
- 💰 **Average Cost per Discharge**
- ⚠️ **Severity of Illness & Risk of Mortality**
- 🧍 **Patient Disposition**
- 📍 **Health Service Areas & Facilities**

Using Power BI, I built an interactive dashboard with clear visuals, slicers, and key insights, enabling users to:

- Compare hospital performance by LOS and cost  
- Identify high-risk and high-cost care areas  
- Explore drivers of LOS and cost using Key Influencers AI visual  
- Understand patient disposition patterns

---

## 📊 Key Features

- **Home Page**: Summary KPIs (Total Hospitals, Total Surgeons, Discharges, LOS)
- **LOS Comparison**: Compare LOS by facility and severity
- **Cost Comparison**: Visualize cost drivers and segment by region
- **Hospital Profiles**: Deep dive into individual hospital performance

---

## 💡 Insights Uncovered

- Facilities in **New York City** show longer average LOS  
- **Extreme severity of illness** and **major risk of mortality** heavily influence increased LOS  
- Some smaller hospitals maintain low costs and short LOS, indicating operational efficiency  
- **Osteoarthritis** was the top diagnosis, representing nearly 90% of discharges in some hospitals
